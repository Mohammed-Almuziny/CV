      <p>
        Over the past 4 years I have continuously challenged myself with new
        languages, frameworks and methodologies. My core languages have always
        been html, css & javascript but I have also worked as a full stack php
        developer building both bespoke CMS solutions and small business
        applications. My current role at IAG is Senior Front End Developer (or
        Senior Software Engineer as IAG prefer to label us) and have been
        developing with React and Redux for the past 4 years.
